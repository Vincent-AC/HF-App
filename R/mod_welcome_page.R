          in the hollow-fibre cartridge, and also to which value you set the
          media flow between the central bottle and the cartridge. At the bottom,
          the tickbox 'is volume constant?' represents assumption on whether the
          volume of media that you inject when you add the drug is negligible
          when compared with the total volume in the setup. If you untick this
          box increase of volume in the central bottle due to drug injection(s)

          simulated in a drop-down menu. The values in these lists are all the
          possible half-lives able to be simulated given your pump specifications
          and the volumes in the central bottle + cartridge. If the desired
          half-life is not in the list, adjusting the volumes in the system or
          using pumps with different characteristics will change the range of
          possible half-lives. Also, you need to provide the desired peak
          concentration after first dose and finally the duration of the
          experiment, which is used for graphs and calculation of the total
          amount of media needed and expanded.",

          interactable graph showing the expected drug concentrations in the
          central bottle (dashed line), and in the cartridge (full line). In
          normal conditions these two overlap, but if the flow from central to
          cartridge is low enough you can distinguish them. By pointing your
          cursor on any point of the lines, you will see the concentrations at
          that point appear on screen. The graph is downloadable in an .svg

          add the measured concentrations as dots on it. To do so you need to
          upload your data in .csv format. This is done at the bottom of the graph.
          The data needs to be formatted so that one row = one measurement,
          which means that for the one drug case you need to have a column with
          the time of measurement and one column for the measured concentration.
          After uploading the csv file you will have to tell the app which
          column label corresponds to the time (x variable) and which
          corresponds to the conentration (y variable). After adding the points
          to the graph, you can download the modified graph by clicking on the
          camera icon at the top of the graph.",

          simulated data that was used for the simulation graph in .csv format
          for further use."
